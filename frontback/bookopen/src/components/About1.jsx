        <p><strong>Alan Moore</strong> is one of the most influential and imaginative writers in the history of comics.</p>
        <p>He transformed comic storytelling by adding depth, emotion, and complex themes that challenged readers to think differently.</p>
        <p>Moore is best known for his powerful works such as <strong>Watchmen, V for Vendetta, Swamp Thing, From Hell, </strong>
            and <strong>The League of Extraordinary Gentlemen.</strong></p>
        <p>
            His stories mix mystery, politics, philosophy, and humanity — proving that comics can be as rich and meaningful as classic literature.
